# danieljamesross.github.io

This is the repository for my personal Github landing page. It uses p5 sketches
with react. It is basically a hacked verion of atarov's [react-hooks-p5js](https://github.com/atorov/react-hooks-p5js).

I will be adding to and expanding this repo over time. If you notice any bugs
then please let me know. Any questions, get in touch.
